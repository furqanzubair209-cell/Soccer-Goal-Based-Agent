# Soccer-Goal-Based-Agent
Python implementation of a Goal-Based Soccer Agent using the PEAS framework. Agent perceives ball and goal, moves step by step, gains possession, and scores.
# Soccer-Goal-Based-Agent

## Overview
This project implements a **Goal-Based Soccer Agent** using the **PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) framework** for an Artificial Intelligence course assignment.

The agent is designed to:

- Perceive its distance from the ball and the goal.
- Move step-by-step toward the ball.
- Gain possession once it reaches the ball.
- Move toward the goal and score.

The agent simulates a simple soccer environment and demonstrates goal-based decision-making.

## Features

- Incremental movement (agent moves step by step, not teleporting)
- Possession logic
- Goal scoring
- Clear Python implementation
